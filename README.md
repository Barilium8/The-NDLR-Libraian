# The NDLR Libraian project - powered by NDLR lovers!
The USB-Serial interface of The NDLR enables users to save/load there data.
 
Hi All,
Conductive Labs created this repository in order to capture the imagination of all those NDLR/Code-monkeys out there!

There have been many requests for The NDLR to have librarian functions to be able to load/save the Presets, Patterns, Rhythms, & Chord Sequences to/from other devices. It has been our intent to do this however we are a tiny team and literally don't the time to do this.  So we decided to open the serial API to The NDLR so this can be achieved by NDLR fans like yourself!

BTW - It is an exercise in serial monitor geekery, but you can actually save/load the data right now using the serial interface via an app like Cool Term.  This method is not intended for end users but can serve as a primer to writing an app.
